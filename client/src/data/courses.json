For centuries, the nature of human intelligence has motivated considerable research and debate: What does it mean for humans to be intelligent? What mental abilities does intelligence refer to? How are these abilities shaped by the environment, cultivated through experience, and represented in the human brain? This course addresses these questions through the lens of modern research in psychology, psychometrics, and cognitive neuroscience. Students will investigate the nature and mechanisms of human intelligence from basic, clinical, and applied disciplines.",

The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the eighth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children.

Second, educators must be able to select, develop, and effectively use appropriate instructional technologies to enhance learning and communication. To meet these needs, this course covers a wide range of instructional technologies that are used for instructional and administrative purposes. Traditional instructional media are considered in the course although significant emphasis is placed on more recent developments that involve the use of the computer and its applications in education. Instructional technologies such as computer-based instruction, computer-based testing, distance learning, interactive video, and intelligent instructional technologies are covered. Through course readings, discussions, and projects, students in the course are expected to gain skills in choosing appropriate instructional technologies, designing effective presentations that rely on those technologies, and properly using instructional technologies to enhance communication with an audience.

We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics.
