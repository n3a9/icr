        "description": "The scope of this course begins amidst the devastation and geopolitical shifts that followed World War II and ends with the effects of globalization in the 1990s and 2000s. We will ask the same questions that faced artists and critics in between: Should art focus on its own material processes or open its borders to historical flux? Is it art's job to create the cultural myths that bind society together, or to deconstruct them? Who participates in modern and contemporary art, and who doesn't? What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them? We will consider, and reconsider, the existing narratives about art during this period with a dual aim: first, to better understand the historical positions of the artists in question, and, second, to piece together a prehistory of the moment in which we currently find ourselves.",

The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the eighth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons.

Clearly manifest throughout these politics is the role of gender, race, nation, and sexuality, as relations of power and as critical factors for social life and creative imagination. This course requires weekly written reflections on the required readings; a written midterm; and a final project, which can be either a research paper or a creative project. The course also requires in-class participation (which will include pop quizzes, group discussion, and other exercises) and one individual or group presentation.

Throughout the course we will cover numerous topics including: the social construction of health and illness, healthcare providers, healthcare systems - including contemporary debates regarding healthcare reform - and the social determinants of health inequalities. Additionally, this course offers an introduction to sociological theories and concepts that may be particularly useful for those interested in pursuing medical school or any career in a health-related field.",

Therefore this course will introduce 1) a brief history of Western and non-Western science, 2) the influences of social categories and oppressions on scientific advancement, 3) the incentive and reward structure of science, and 4) stories of scientists who have chosen to walk a brave path in the way they conduct and disseminate their research. We will engage in a mix of ethnographic and case study work and bring interpretive and systematic analysis to bear on what it means to be a scientist. The ultimate goal of the course is to provide a substantive, rigorous, and broad introduction to the culture of science, and how that culture affects the people of science, its practice, and its process.",

Time permitting, we will also discuss computational problems in microbiome analysis, protein function and structure prediction, genome assembly, and even historical linguistics. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology. The technical material will depend on discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children.

Among the dozens of important relevant issues in this field are the successes and failures of law in policing cultural heritage crimes, the rise of artistic nationalism, cultural heritage as a casualty of war, censorship, and provenance studies.

We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics.
