We will engage in a mix of ethnographic and case study work and bring interpretive and systematic analysis to bear on what it means to be a scientist.

Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology.

The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the eighth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres.

There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children.

        "description": "This course is designed to address issues of language and literacy, not only for language arts teachers, but all educators in all disciplines and at all levels, where students are required to represent their knowledge in writing as well as other media. It will introduce the 'Multiliteracies' theory of literacy learning which recognizes that the contemporary communications environment is increasingly multimodal. Written language today is more closely connected with oral, visual, gestural, tactile and spatial modes. To remain relevant, effective pedagogy needs to connect with the new communications media, and to explore their underlying processes. The course will focus on current trends in literacy instruction, not only in language arts or composition classes, but academic literacies across all curriculum areas. The course will also investigate the implications of new media of language and literacy and explore the implications of developments in the contemporary media, particularly the new, digital media. 4 graduate hours.

Students will be instructed in the finer points of professional film production, including casting, rehearsal, scheduling, blocking, assembly, rushes, and other aspects of the workflow of fiction filmmaking. There will be a division of labor on each project. The class will be divided into two crews consisting of assigned positions. These positions are assigned by the instructor based on a student's previous performance in MACS production courses (particularly MACS 370). The positions are: Producer (production manager/assistant director, location scout), Director, Production Designer (promotion and graphics, unit still photographer; script supervisor), Director of Photography (assistant sound mixer), Assistant Camera (colorist), Gaffer (assistant colorist), Sound Designer (recordist/mixer), and Editor (production designer’s assistant; boom operator).

What are the constraints that narrative form, production routines, financing and distribution put on representing environmental problems and environmentalists? Is the information in the film to be trusted? In documentaries, are physical and social scientists’ explanations of environmental problems and solutions reliable? What cues can we use from within and outside the film to evaluate the film for credibility? During the course participants will compare the science and economics of selected environmental issues with film presentations, examine what drives of environmental participation (and the limits of film in presenting science), and look at the constraints of producing special interest versus broad distribution films on presentations of the environment.

We consider how different dimensions of inequality have evolved over time, with special focus on inequalities across race, class, and gender. We assess how inequality shapes the lives of individuals in society, how and why inequality persists, and how people have worked to both challenge and reproduce their places in society. We approach social inequality from a variety of angles, developing an understanding of how inequality works in and through schooling, labor markets, employment, identity and prejudice, social mobility, and the role of major social institutions such as work, family, education, politics and law. We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. By the end of this course, you will have a clearer understanding of the types of inequality that exist in society, how inequality operates through the broader social context, and the constraints and opportunities faced by individuals in different positions in society.
